Several methods are use to compare multibyte characters. Important to use mb variant of a method when available
mb_strlen
mb_strtolower
mb_str_split

There are also several methods to check the type of variable (or it's implicit type in this case)
is_bool
is_file -> will return false if the file doesn't exist (useful to check in order to avoid errors)
is_numeric -> Particularly useful to check if a string is a number (float or int)
is_string
is_int
is_float
is_array
is_null

Superglobal variables :
$_POST -> Useful to get values from the post request
$_GET -> Useful to get values from the get request
$_SERVER -> Can be used to check if the server is using a secure connection or not (http vs https)
$_SESSION -> Info about the session
$_COOKIES -> Info about cookies

Constants can be defined in two ways (number 2 is preferable)
1: define("ACONST", 12);
2: const ACONST = 12;
